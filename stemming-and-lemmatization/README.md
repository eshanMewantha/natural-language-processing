### Lemmatization is the process of determining the lemma, or the morphological root, of an inflected word based on its context. Lemmas are the base forms of words that are used to key the word in a dictionary. 

### Stemming has a similar goal to lemmatization, but it does not attempt to produce the morphological roots of words. Instead, stemming removes all patterns of characters that appear to be affixes, resulting in a token that is not necessarily a valid word. 

### Lemmatization frequently requires a lexical resource, like WordNet, and the word's part of speech. 

### Stemming algorithms frequently use rules instead of lexical resources to produce stems and can operate on any token, even without its context.
